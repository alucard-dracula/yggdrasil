Hello there,

I have found a temporary workaround to enable 3gB user space addressing.

Will need to open command prompt as an administrator, then type

bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVa 3072

Followed by

cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin
editbin /LARGEADDRESSAWARE "C:\SysGCC\raspberry\libexec\gcc\arm-linux-gnueabihf\4.9\cc1plus.exe"
The first part enables 3gB user space for 32 bit applications globally. This might not need be done on Windows 64bit, I think it sets it automatically as long as the application is LargeAddressAware flag set

However, cc1plus.exe does not have largeaddressaware set during compilation, so you will need to set this flag manually. The second command is what does this using a Visual Studio tool editbin.exe

The actual path to this application may be different depending on what version of Visual Studio is used.

This is a temporary workaround because the application may exceed 3gB usage on a per-case scenarion.

Luckily the cc1plus.exe memory usages is on a per-file basis, and it resets when it begins compiling a new file. So it will only be a problem if there are a lot of nested includes in 1 cpp file.

Thanks,
